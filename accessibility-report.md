Principles of Universal Design

	1.	Equitable Use:
	•	Our program adheres to equitable use by offering features such as “search songs by description” and “search songs by keyword and artist,” which allow users with diverse music preferences to easily find songs regardless of specific knowledge about artists or genres.
	•	Future enhancements could include adding a text-to-speech feature to ensure visually impaired users can interact with the program seamlessly.
	2.	Flexibility in Use:
	•	Features like “get song recommendations based on your music preferences” adapt to different user tastes and listening behaviors, offering personalized recommendations.
	•	We could add language options in the future to accommodate non-English speakers, ensuring the interface is accessible to a broader audience.
	3.	Simple and Intuitive Use:
	•	The program’s interface for “search songs by keyword and artist” is designed to be straightforward, so even first-time users can understand and interact with it effectively.
	•	Tooltips or brief explanations could be added to further improve intuitiveness, helping users unfamiliar with some features.
	4.	Perceptible Information:
	•	Users can clearly view and navigate their “top tracks” and “song recommendations” without requiring prior knowledge, thanks to a well-organized and readable display.
	•	To improve accessibility, we could implement audio cues for visually impaired users.
	5.	Tolerance for Error:
	•	If users make typos while using the “search songs by keyword and artist” feature, the program could provide suggestions for corrections or display close matches.
	•	Future updates could include an undo feature to revert accidental actions, such as removing a song from a playlist.
	6.	Low Physical Effort:
	•	The program minimizes physical effort by providing quick access to “top tracks” and “similar artists” through single-click or tap actions.
	•	Voice command integration could be a future addition, further reducing physical interaction requirements.
	7.	Size and Space for Approach and Use:
	•	The program’s interface is responsive and designed for both desktop and mobile platforms, ensuring that it remains functional and accessible regardless of the user’s device or screen size.
	•	Future updates could optimize the app further for assistive devices, like screen readers or one-handed operation.

Target Market

If we were to market the program, our primary audience would include music enthusiasts and Spotify users who want to enhance their music discovery experience. This includes students seeking new music for studying or relaxation, casual listeners looking for recommendations, and advanced users who want insights like “similar listeners.” Additionally, our program could appeal to professionals in creative fields, like writers or designers, who use music to inspire their work. By focusing on personalization and intuitive search features, we aim to attract users who value ease of use and customization in their music experience.

Demographic Considerations

Our program is less likely to be used by people who do not use Spotify, as all features are designed around Spotify’s API and ecosystem. Additionally, some demographics may face barriers, such as those without internet access, non-English speakers, or users unfamiliar with digital music platforms. To mitigate this, we could add offline features or expand language support. Drawing from the ethics modules, we recognize the importance of accessibility for users with disabilities. As such, we plan to incorporate features like text-to-speech, voice commands, and screen reader compatibility to ensure that our program does not exclude these demographics. By addressing these considerations, we aim to create a more inclusive and universally appealing tool.
